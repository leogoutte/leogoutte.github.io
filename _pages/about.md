I am currently a master's student in Tami Pereg-Barnea's condensed matter theory group at McGill University. My research interests lie broadly in solving condensed matter problems related to topology, quantum information, and Moiré physics with a focus on theory and computation. 

I love to write, and have held a wide range of pedagogical, outreach, and science writing positions at McGill and other Montréal organizations.

Please don't hesitate to contact me for any questions about my work or anything else!
