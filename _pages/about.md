I am currently a PhD student in the laboratory for theoretical physics of nanosystems at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, where I am working on quantum computing with bosonic codes and open quantum systems. Previously, I did my master's in Tami Pereg-Barnea's condensed matter theory group at McGill University, in Montréal, Québec.

My research interests lie broadly in quantum information and topology with a focus on theory and computation. I love to write, and have held a wide range of pedagogical, outreach, and science writing positions at McGill and other organizations in Montréal.

Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions about my work, or anything else!
